    <h2>Code Review</h2>
    <p>
      The code review process allowed me to evaluate my previous work through a more professional and critical lens.
      During this review, I analyzed structure, readability, documentation quality, modular design, and maintainability.
      Rather than focusing solely on functionality, I evaluated whether the code was written clearly enough for other
      developers to understand and maintain.
    </p>

    <p>
      The review identified opportunities to improve inline comments, clarify method responsibilities, and enhance
      documentation explaining algorithmic intent. While the original code functioned correctly, improvements were made
      to strengthen readability and professional presentation standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      This review reinforced the importance of clean code practices, structured logic, and consistent formatting.
      Professional development requires not only solving problems but ensuring that solutions are understandable,
      maintainable, and scalable.
