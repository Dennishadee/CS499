    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>Completing the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has allowed me to demonstrate both my technical growth and my professional readiness to enter the software industry. Throughout the program, I strengthened my ability to analyze problems, implement working solutions, and reflect on how to improve code quality beyond simple functionality. While the core functionality of my artifacts remained intact, I focused my enhancements on improving code readability, documentation, and clarity. These improvements reflect an important professional skill: writing maintainable and understandable code.</p>

<p>Over time, I learned that professional software development is not only about making programs work correctly. It also involves writing code that other developers can read, understand, and maintain. Clean structure, meaningful comments, and consistent formatting are essential to long-term project success. As I revised my artifacts for inclusion in my ePortfolio, I concentrated on strengthening internal documentation, clarifying variable names where needed, and improving the readability of logic so that future developers, or even my future self, could easily follow the program flow.</p>

<p>In the 7-1 Project artifact, which demonstrates software design and engineering principles, my updates focused on improving inline comments and clarifying the purpose of methods and structural components. Rather than altering the underlying functionality, I enhanced the code to better explain how different components interact and why certain design decisions were made. By clearly documenting responsibilities within the program, I improved maintainability and demonstrated awareness of clean architecture practices. These updates reflect an understanding that well-documented code supports collaboration and long-term scalability.</p>

<p>In the CS 250 artifact, which demonstrates algorithms and data structures, I enhanced the clarity of the logic by adding detailed comments explaining how data structures were used and how sorting and searching processes functioned. I refined comments to describe algorithmic intent rather than simply restating code behavior. These changes make the program easier to follow and highlight the reasoning behind the implementation choices. Even without modifying the algorithms themselves, improving documentation strengthens the professional quality of the work and shows deeper comprehension of the underlying concepts.</p>

<p>In the CS 300 artifact, which demonstrates database concepts and structured data handling, my enhancements focused on explaining how data was organized, processed, and retrieved. I improved comments to clarify the flow of data through the program and to document assumptions about inputs and outputs. By making the code more readable and easier to interpret, I reinforced the importance of transparency and maintainability when working with structured information.</p>

<p>Across all artifacts, the primary enhancement theme was readability. I ensured that method purposes were clearly described, logic blocks were visually organized, and comments provided meaningful explanations rather than unnecessary repetition. Improving readability is a critical software engineering skill because most real-world development involves maintaining or extending existing code. Clean and well-documented code reduces onboarding time for new developers, minimizes misinterpretation, and lowers the risk of introducing errors during future modifications.</p>

<p>These enhancements demonstrate that I understand professional development standards extend beyond functional correctness. Writing maintainable, readable, and clearly documented code reflects a mature development mindset. While the original implementations fulfilled assignment requirements, refining documentation and clarity elevated the artifacts to a more professional standard suitable for presentation in an ePortfolio.</p>

<p>Together, the 7-1 Project artifact for software design and engineering, the CS 250 artifact for algorithms and data structures, and the CS 300 artifact for databases demonstrate not only technical competency but also a commitment to professional code quality. This portfolio reflects my growth from focusing solely on functionality to recognizing the importance of maintainability, clarity, and structured documentation in real-world software development.</p>
